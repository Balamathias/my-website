  <h1>My Life, My Rules⟩</h1>
  <h2>Chapter <span>1</span></h2>
  <p><q>You know Hannah, we've been friends for sometime now and having stayed together as hostel mates, I've been continuously bordered by a particular question which I intend to ask you right now. I've noticed for a while now that you don't have any male gendered friend and you don't even talk to any during and after school hours...so what's the matter?</q>Sally, Hannah's friend asked quite worried.</p>
  <p>Hannah heaved a sigh at the question. It had been an issue she has not been able to compromise. Hannah have stayed with Sally for sometime now as hostel mates. Their relationship has been on the intimate level and for Hannah, It would not be right to keep the answer from her...Hannah couldn't respond immediately, <q>It's a long story...</q>,She said.</p>
  <p>The quite peaceful atmosphere of the hostel tended towards a serious one. Sally understands situations like this whenever Hannah alters her facial expression. Hannah is known for her extraordinary beauty and her captivating gestures. Her beauty captures the attention of every man at sight. Her dovial eyes and her oval shaped faced fits neatly into her smooth soft long hair. Her complexion is actually between fair and chocolate. She looks more beautiful on lemon-green as it has always been her most cherished color. Even at that, 
  Hannah is a 'no-go-area' for young men!</p>
  <p>Hannah repeated again that it was 'a long story...!'. Hannah was still struggling to figure out how she'd begin her story. It was a sad one that summoned her tears. <q>I hate men!</q>,She stressed as tears streamed down her paired eyes. Sally understood this and remained quiet to listen.<q>I can never trust men!</q>, She stressed again!...</p>
  <p><q>How can I trust a man?...A man ruined my life! A man raped me when I was just nine! and you expect me trust a man?</q>Hannah stressed lamenting. Sally drew close to her and sympathized with her.<q>A man abandoned my mom and I to suffer just for another woman! My heart can never be healed as it concerns men for the cruelty of men has eroded my heart!</q>,Hannah stressed, lamenting even more.<q>It's okay Hannah, I feel your pains... I'm sorry about all you have passed through. I'm assuring you that no matter what as long as the Lord lives, I will always be by your side. It's okay dear, please don't cry.</q> Sally sympathized wiping off her tears and giving her optimistic morales.<q>Thank you Sally...you have always been my friend and you will always be. I have kept this to myself often and I hardly tell it to anyone. You have given me hope. </q>,Hannah said as she succumbed to the sympathy of Sally.*****</p>
  <p style="font-size:30px">*****************</p>
  <h3>The next day, during school hours...</h3>
  <p><q>Omo! Guy, look at that damsel, she's so beautiful!</q>A guy tapped another guy to behold Hannah as she and Sally walked to the hall for their lectures from a distance. Hannah placed her books on her chest while they mimed along the way in an engaging conversation. The other guy turning to see,<q>Omo! Dis bae fine die.</q>, They both make attempts to summon her attention towards them by hissing quite loud...just as the hissing grew intense, Sally and Hannah both diffused towards a corner leading to their hall. Although, not having any knowledge that the hissing was being directed to them. The guys felt dipleased and uttered that they've lost some vibes...</p>
  <p><q>Bro, I'd be on my way now because I will be having lectures any time soon</q>, A young man named Samuel said as he piled his lecture notes to hurry down to the hall.<q>Alright bro, see you later</q> his roommate Andrew baded him goodbye as he left the hostel for the lectures...</p>***
  <h3>After the lectures,</h3>
  <p>As Hannah and Sally both left the lecture hall, Sally informed Hannah that she was having an 'appointment' with a particular guy, her course mate. She informed her that she was having some practical stuffs to sort out with this guy called Samuel since he was very smart. She actually needed some guidance. Hannah agreed to the proposal and baded Sally 'see you later' as she headed for the hostel.</p>
  <p>As Hannah walked up the aisles to her hostel, she was approached by a neatly dressed guy with cultured beards, wearing a well ironed jean trouser with Polo* having an inscription 'There Is Time For Everything'.<q>Hi pretty, just a second please</q>, the guy requested. Many thoughts flashed through her mind but later agreed to listen to what this 'god-forsaken-gender' had to tell her.<q>Okay,</q> She said. <q>You look beautiful! Your beauty caught my attention and I found it pleasing to have a word with you.</q>The young man admired as they clinged to a nearby shade. Hannah kept silent and thought within herself: <q>He is some sort of an unreal man, nothing more than my beauty captured his attention, what of if I was ugly? So he would not have approached me...Men are men and they will not be any that is different!</q>.<q>If you don't mind telling me your name, I am Mosh and you?</q>. 
  Hannah was partially lost in her thought when she was suddenly drawn back by that question...<q>I'm sorry, I have to go now. I have something urgent to attend to</q>, Hannah said leaving the premises. Mosh was held in a suspense and harnessed manly confidence to subvert the embarrassment.</p>
  <p>Hannah hurried down to her hostel and placed her books on her bed while she sat down reminiscing about life. She regretted ever giving a second to a <em>MAN!</em>*****</p>
  <p><q>Hi Samuel, I'm here...</q><q>...Oh Sis Sally, you're welcome. Please have a seat, I'll attend to you immediately.</q>, gentle Samuel said as he baded his friends he was initially conversing with goodbye.<q>Trust you had a blessed day</q>.<q>Yes I did and you?</q>.<q>It was all blessed and wonderful...um so you said you were having an issue with a particular topic, let me see that.</q>.<q>Oh yeah! Alright, here it is...</q>*****</p>
  <p>Sally was able to understand what Samuel had explained and left for the hostel as she baded samuel farewell. On reaching the hostel, she gradually squeaked the door of her room open...<q>Hi Hannah</q>.<q>Oh, you're back. How was it?</q>. Hannah asked quite concerned.<q>you wont believe me...!</q><q>Wow! can't wait to hear the great news!</q>.Hannah said in great excitement.<q>Okay, okay, the good news is that...I finally understood the topic I have been battling with for long now. Glory be to God!</q>. Hannah was very happy for her friend. Sally gave her the full gist of how a guy helped her out. Hannah didn't feel anything different when she heard it was a guy. She believed that <em>MEN were always MEN!</em></p>
  <h3>In the hostel with her friend,Sally.</h3>
  <p>Sally playfully asked Hannah about what they'd be preparing tonight...Hannah excitedly said<q>We're gonna eat momma's type</q> with a smile painted face.<q>You're such a smart girl, you knew exactly what I had in mind.</q>Sally said as they laughed to stupor. Sally has always been a good friend who understands the weaknesses of Hannah and helps her in such areas. After sometime, having enjoyed their supper, Sally brought up a topic that involved the life of Hannah and her major enemy-<em>MEN!</em></p>
  <p><q>Bestie, I've been thinking about something for long now and it's about you. Can't you just try your best to you know regain the association you once had with the other gender in one way or the other?</q>Sally asked quite concerned. Hannah heaved a sigh and said<q>I cannot just imagine myself being in that state anymore. My mind is made up and made up for good!</q> Hannah said with a genuine expression.<q>What about marriage, have you considered that?</q>.Sally asked looking up to Hannah.<q>Hmmm... it's not something I should think twice before saying... I'm better off single forever! I cannot measure the cruelty of MEN! They're all the same!</q>. <q>Well, but not for all men. There are some good ones out there! You just need to be patient enough</q>Sally advised.<q>I don't think so and I don't want to imagine myself think so!</q>. Hannah stressed.</p>
  <p style="font-size:35px">***************</p>
  <p><q>...Okay Mum, thank you for calling,love you mom...See you soon</q>. Sally said ending the call.<q>I guess that was your mom.</q>Hannah suggested.<q>Yeah,she was, she's always worried about me</q>.Sally said proudly.<q>Yeah, I agree with you too. Mommies are the best-just like my mom, she's always willing to spend her last penny to help me attain excellence.</q>Hannah said supportively...<q>Yeah, I'm always proud of Momma but I love Poppa* the most!</q>. Sally said feeling proud of her father. Sally unaware at first retorted<q>I'm sorry</q>, having sensed that that wouldn't go down well with her most cherished friend ,Hannah. Hannah willfully accepted Sally's apology and headed towards her Bible. They both sang worship songs and got inspired. They finally slept off...<q>Goodnight!</q>,Sally said as she dived into the duvet.<q>Sweet dreams...</q></p>
